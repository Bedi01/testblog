  This is my 6th day in ryaz.io which was very exciting than any other day cause i got to know more about web development and moreover about hmtl and css. Those features are aspect ratio and source src in css and html respectively. I got familiar with aspect ratio very easily and i faced challanges in source src and dont know alot about it , But hey i can overcome any challanges and i am ready to face any challanges. Overall the day was good and happening with lot of challanges and knowledge and with that i am ready to face any challanges which are coming in future.
